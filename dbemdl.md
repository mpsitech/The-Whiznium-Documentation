# WhizniumDBE Model Files

WhizniumDBE accepts model information input either as tab-separated .txt files (edit with Excel / LibreOfficeCalc recommended) or as .xml files. 

For tool initialitation, optionally using WhizniumDBE Bootstrap, these two model files are used:

* [Initialization data](dbemdl/IexWdbeIni.md)
* [Projects and versions](dbemdl/IexWdbePrj.md)

Two main model files hold the model information of WhizniumDBE-backed projects, they are preferrably applied using WhizniumDBE Iterator:

* [Basic device description](dbemdl/IexWdbeBdd.md)
* [Detailed device description](dbemdl/IexWdbeDdd.md)
